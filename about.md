# Who Am I?
Software Engineer, 6 years in the wilderness. I\'ve worked as a Build/Release Engineer, then moved to Ops, currently 
I\'m working as a Developer with some Ops on the side. 

# Interests
Right now I\'m doing a deep dive into the infrastructure/config management world. 
Mainly using Nix/NixOs but also some Ansible, Terraform and Powershell DSC .

A bunch of active things I\'m playing with:

  * [vulgr](https://bitbucket.org/dashboard/repositories?watching=true&projectOwner=vulgr&projectKey=VUL) - 
    a tool for security analysis of project dependencies. 
  * [forge](https://bitbucket.org/wayofthepie/forge) - terraform config for building out continuous delivery build 
    infrastructure on AWS. 
  * [neo4j-bolt](https://github.com/wayofthepie/neo4j-bolt) - a haskell library implementing the Neo4j _bolt_ protocol.
  * [sip](https://github.com/wayofthepie/sip) - a haskell library of parsers for Linux systems.

There are plenty more toy projects beyond those! Check out my github or bitbucket accounts below (on the footer) 
if you\'re interested.
